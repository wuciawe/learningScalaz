    // Under Memo object there are some default implementations of Memo
    // like Memo.mutableHashMapMemo[K, V], Memo.weakHashMapMemo[K, V],
    // and Memo.arrayMemo[V].

    // In general, we should be careful with any of these optimization
    // techniques. First the overall performance should be profiled to see
    // if it in fact would contribute to time savings, and second
    // space trade-off needs to be analyzed so it doesnâ€™t grow endlessly.

    // An expression e is referentially transparent if every
    // occurrence e can be replaced with its value without affecting
    // the observable result of the program.

    // Memoization is one way of taking the advantage of
    // referential transparency.
